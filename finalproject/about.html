 <h2>Being Trans </h2>
 <aside>Some of these terms will be explained later. Stay tune!</aside>
    <p>I am Kyle Levy. I am black and genderqueer. The purpose of this website is to mitigate the damage that has been done by transgender hate speech and propaganda. I want to write about transgender identities to inform cisgender people. And I also want to support the transgender community, which I hold near and dear to my heart. </p> <br>


    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <aside>Lessons Learned</aside>
    <p> This website was a project for my web design class. The challenges for this project were getting everything the way I wanted it to look. For example, I had trouble moving items next to each other. My triumphs were getting the images to appear the first I tried, and getting my external links to correctly link to other sites. When testing my site on different browsers and devices, I noticed that there are slight differences in how images, colors, and forms are displayed.  
    </p>
    <p> I learned a myriad of things from this class. I learned that practicing and being patient is the key to learning how to code. I learned that asking for help right away when I do not understand something is very important. I learned that despite the fact that coding is hard sometimes, I would like to become a web developer.</p>
