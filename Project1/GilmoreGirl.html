 <h1>Gilmore Girls</h1>
 <aside>Best show ever! </aside>
 <p> Gilmore Girls has been my favorite show for years. I love the family dynamics and the humor. I have watched the show more times then I can remember. Lorelai Gilmore is my favorite character because she so smart and funny. Her relationship with her daughter Rory is something I strive for in all my relationship with people. They have open and honset communication.
